                    <h2>REFLEX</h2>
                    <p>A colorful, dynamic shooter in which you control a small ship and avoid incoming cubes by maneuvering past them, shooting them, exploding them, or even teleporting past them. Earn money by acquiring achievements and collecting coins, and buy upgrades to change the appearance and functionality of your ship. Level up, and the game gets more exciting, more colorful, and more difficult. Just remember: dodge, duck, dip, dive, and... dodge</p>
                    <p>I consider Reflex my most successful project, as it's by far my most developed project and the only one I've published to the app store or a gaming website so far. I made it in Adobe Flash in ActionScript 3. Unfortunately, Flash isn't quite meant for mobile devices, so the mobile versions of this game are a bit clunkier than they are on a laptop, however they still work pretty well. I was also unable to publish the game to Apple but it is available on the play store for Android. I also published it to kongregate.com <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/zdizzler/reflex-impulse">HERE</a>, and you can see the github repository <a href="https://github.com/zdizzler/Reflex">HERE</a>. I spent a total of maybe 9 months of relaxed work on it until I finally published it in August of 2013. I made it all myself, apart from the music, which my friend Bardia Nikfarjam made. The web version of the game is set up to the right, enjoy :D</p>

                    <h2>64</h2>
                    <p>Chess meets RPG. Exactly the same piece movement but different combat. Attacking opens a much more interesting field in which all pieces involved fight each other, regenerate health and mana, use abilities, and level up. Battle harder and harder opponents to collect items and gain experience</p>
                    <p>My weird take on chess. I used to play chess as a kid and I was very good at it, but I wanted to mix it up, and adding an RPG element to the classic game of chess certainly did that. This is still very much a work in progress, not really near completion. It's very interesting though and it introduced me to a lot of coding elements I had never dealt with before, like 3D and AI. The AI for this game actually plays it pretty well, and isn't like a typical chess AI, since this game is by no means the same thing as chess. It's pretty fun to play, and the real thing is more dynamic than the example to the left as not all the piece's abilities are shown. This was probably my biggest project, and involved a LOT of code. It still has a lot of errors, which will probably become evident as you play the game. The source code can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/zdizzler/64">HERE</a>.</p>

                    <h2>THE CAVE</h2>
                    <p>You've stumbled upon your wildest fantasy! A buried treasure in the deepest depths of a cave. But right as you begin to process what has happened, you hear shuffles coming from the darkness. You must protect your new discovery at all costs. Use the arrow keys and the Z button to choose and select start menu items. While in game, use the arrow keys to move your character, the A and S keys to rotate your character, and the Z button to shoot. Don't let anything touch you or your treasure or it's game over!</p>
                    <p>This project was actually done as homework for a class I took at Georgia Tech, but I went way beyond the requirements because it was right up my alley (it's actually the only thing on this site which was done for homework). This game was actually programmed for the Gameboy Advance and must be played with an emulator. It's also written in C, which was a bit of a change for me as I usually write in object-oriented languages. It has a very similar feel to an arcade game, and this is on purpose; arcade games are simple but very fun, and I wanted to put out my own take on an arcade game. I really, really liked coding this in C, I think it's a very interesting language, and I hope to make more projects in it.

                    <h2>FOCUS</h2>
                    <p>Zombie survival! You've crashed in your helicopter in a quarantined city which will be leveled in five days and you must escape the city. Explore buildings, collect items, craft items, and kill zombies to escape the city unharmed, or watch yourself become infected like the others</p>
                    <p>My very first Flash project! Which is very evident, it doesn't really look clean at all, there's a lot of content missing, and the code is very inefficient. I bit off more than I could chew with this one, and it just started blowing up in my face. I did a lot of art for this one though, which gave me some good experience, as well as a lot of code, which also gave me lots of experience working in later projects. Great idea though, I'm seeing this sort of thing done with games today (like Unturned) which involve some sort of crafting or 'escape the room' element with a survival RPG element. I last touched this back in 2011, but it being my first project, I wanted to hold onto it. The source code can be seen <a href="https://github.com/zdizzler/Focus">HERE</a></p>
