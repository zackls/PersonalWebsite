                    <h2>REFLEX</h2>
                    <p>A colorful, dynamic shooter in which you control a small ship and avoid incoming cubes by maneuvering past them, shooting them, exploding them, or even teleporting past them. Earn money by acquiring achievements and collecting coins, and buy upgrades to change the appearance and functionality of your ship. Level up, and the game gets more exciting, more colorful, and more difficult. Just remember: dodge, duck, dip, dive, and... dodge</p>
                    <p>I consider Reflex my most successful project, as it's by far my most developed project and the only one I've published to the app store or a gaming website so far. I made it in Adobe Flash in ActionScript 3. Unfortunately, Flash isn't quite meant for mobile devices, so the mobile versions of this game are a bit clunkier than they are on a laptop, however they still work pretty well. I was also unable to publish the game to Apple (which I'm extremely unhappy about, I spent $100 for their tools not to work) but it is available on the play store for Android. I also published it to kongregate.com <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/zdizzler/reflex-impulse">HERE</a>, and you can see the github repository <a href="https://github.com/zdizzler/Reflex">HERE</a>. I spent a total of maybe 9 months of relaxed work on it until I finally published it in August of 2013. I made it all myself, apart from the music, which my friend Bardia Nikfarjam made. The web version of the game is set up to the right, enjoy :D</p>

                    <p>Chess meets RPG. Exactly the same piece movement but different combat. Attacking opens a much more interesting field in which all pieces involved fight each other, regenerate health and mana, use abilities, and level up. Battle harder and harder opponents to collect items and gain experience</p>
                    <p>Chess gone really, really weird. I used to play chess as a kid and I liked the logic involved in it, and it just so happens that logical things lend themselves well to coding. I wanted to mix it up though, and adding an RPG element to the classic game of chess certainly did that. This is still very much a work in progress, not really near completion. It's a very interesting though and it introduced me to a lot of coding elements I had never dealt with before, like 3D and AI. The AI for this game actually plays it pretty well, and isn't like a typical chess AI, since this game is by no means the same thing as chess. It's pretty fun to play, and the real thing is more dynamic than the example to the left as not all the piece's abilities are shown. This was probably my biggest project, and involved a LOT of code. It still has a lot of errors, which will probably become evident as you play the game. The source code can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/zdizzler/64">HERE</a>.</p>

                    <p>Zombie survival! You've crashed in your helicopter in a quarantined city which will be leveled in five days and you must escape the city. Explore buildings, collect items, craft items, and kill zombies to escape the city unharmed, or watch yourself become infected like the others</p>
                    <p>My very first Flash project! Which is very evident, it doesn't really look clean at all, there's a lot of content missing, and the code is very inefficient. I bit off more than I could chew with this one, and it just started blowing up in my face. I did a lot of art for this one though, which gave me some good experience, as well as a lot of code, which also gave me lots of experience working in later projects. Great idea though, I'm seeing this sort of thing done with games today (like Unturned) which involve some sort of crafting or 'escape the room' element with a survival RPG element. I last touched this back in 2011, but it being my first project, I wanted to hold onto it. The source code can be seen <a href="https://github.com/zdizzler/Focus">HERE</a></p>
