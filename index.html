                    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                    <p>My name's Zack Littke-Smith, welcome to my website! I'm twenty years old and I'm an undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. I'm majoring in Computer Science here. I've always loved the pure logic of code, and the seemingly limitless amount of things you can accomplish with it. I started out coding during my freshman year of high school, and I didn't even know that what I was doing was even called computer science, I just wanted to make a video game. I got better and better at it through online tutorials and trial and error, until I was finally able to finish and publish something. My school offered no computer science classes, so I founded a computer science club in my junior year to try and teach/learn from other students. When my senior year came around, the school had decided that it was time to add a computer science course to the curriculum (AP Computer Science) so that students could learn about coding in a more consistent and structured way. I was very happy to hear this, and it's only inspired me more. Some of my projects include several video games I've made, a graphing program, this website (which I've made entirely from scratch), and many more. But I wouldn't be human if all I did was coding: I also write poetry, create art (I created all the pictures on this site), play tennis and basketball, lift weights, and try to live life to the fullest! I've even done stand up comedy on one occasion. Every second you spend alive on this planet should be filled with new experiences and happiness, because you can't get those seconds back. I have two older sisters: Ali, the younger one, graduated from the College of Charleston with a degree in political science, and is in the picture with me to the right; Megan, the older one, graduated from SUNY Oneonta with a degree in mathematics and lives nearby in Atlanta. I myself have only graduated from Lassiter High School in Marietta, GA, but I plan on graduating from Georgia Tech soon, and possibly attending grad school after that. But that's enough about me, enjoy the site</p>
