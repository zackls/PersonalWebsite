                    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                    <p>My name's Zack Littke-Smith, welcome to my website! I'm twenty years old and I'm an undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. I'm majoring in Computer Science here. I've always loved the pure logic of code, and the seemingly limitless amount of things you can accomplish with it. I started out coding during my freshman year of high school, I just wanted to make a video game. I got better and better at it through online tutorials and trial and error, until I was finally able to finish and publish something. My school offered no computer science classes, so I founded a computer science club to try to both teach and learn from other students. Some of my projects include several video games I've made, a graphing program, this website (which I've made entirely from scratch), and many more. But I wouldn't be human if all I did was coding: I also write poetry, create art (I created all the images and graphics on this site), play tennis and basketball, lift weights, and try to live life to the fullest! I've even done stand up comedy on a couple occasions. Every second you spend alive on this planet should be filled with new experiences and happiness, because you can't get those seconds back. I have only graduated from Lassiter High School, but I plan on graduating from Georgia Tech soon, and who knows where life could take me after that. I really hope to do great things. But that's enough about me, enjoy the site</p>
