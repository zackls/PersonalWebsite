                    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                    <p>My name's Zack Littke-Smith, welcome to my website! I'm nineteen years old and I'm an undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. I'm majoring in Computer Science here as I have always loved the pure logic of code. Some of my projects include several video games I've made, some graphing programs, this website (which I've made entirely from scratch), and many more. I've always enjoyed the creative side of Computer Science, and I hope to continue being able to exercise my creativity in coding. But I wouldn't be human if all I did was coding: I also write poetry, create art (I created all the pictures on this site), play tennis, and try to live life to the fullest! I've even done stand up comedy on one occasion, which went a lot better than I thought it would. I believe that every second you spend alive on this planet should be filled with new experiences and happiness, because you can't get those seconds back. Sorry, it's hard for me to write long things like this about myself and not get philosophical. Anyways, I have two older sisters: Ali, the younger one, graduated from the College of Charleston, and is in the picture with me to the right; Megan, the older one, graduated from SUNY Oneonta in New York but lives in Atlanta. I myself have only graduated from Lassiter High School in Marietta, GA, but I plan on graduating from Georgia Tech soon, and possibly attending grad school after that. That's enough about me, enjoy the site! :D</p>
