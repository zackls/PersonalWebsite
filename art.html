                    <h2>AUTODESK 3DS MAX</h2>
                    <p>I do almost all of my 3D work in Autodesk 3DS Max, athough I haven't actually needed to export to 3D yet. I always loved the abstract images I found online that I would use for my desktop background, and I wanted to learn how to create my own, so I messed around in 3DS Max and these are what I got. The four images you may cycle through in the "Change Theme" option on the nav bar are all 2D renders of 3D environments that I made in 3DS max. I made all these abstract scenes as their own separate projects, they weren't ever intended for anything specific. Besides these images, I've also made 3D images for games in Flash (predominantly chess pieces for 64), but had to use the 2D renders since the version of Flash I was using didn't support 3D images. Click the image to the right to cycle through things I've made. 3DS Max is an extremely fun program and I still have a lot to learn from it</p>

                    <h2>ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR</h2>
                    <p>I've used Adobe Illustrator for A LOT of the generic art for my games. Illustrator is a program that specializes in vector drawing, and I can't stress enough how useful and easy it has been. It took a little while to learn, but once I got going, it was awesome to me. I haven't made a single gaming project without at least 75% of the art and drawing being made in Illustrator. Reflex is the only exception to this, as almost all of the drawing in Reflex is made by code. But seriously I've been so dependent on this program, I would be nowhere without it. I put a bit of the stuff I've made on the pictures to the left. Click to cycle through them.</p>
